# CSharpInSimpleTerms
This project aims to describe all of C#'s features with simple, clean language. The series assumes you know nothing about C#, and want to start with the basics, though the posts can be read in any order. 

The publish order and dates for the posts are below. The original project was supposed to last 18 posts; posts 19 and later are part of the "addendum" that I added later, hence those posts will come out weekly instead of twice-a-week. 

As always, pull requests are welcome!
