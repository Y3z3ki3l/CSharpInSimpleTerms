            //All structs used in this application are defined in the Structs.cs file

            //Structure types (or structs) are small, focused collections of properties.
            //Structs are value types, and can have methods, properties, and constructors.
            //In that way, they are similar to classes.
            //However, structs cannot have a parameterless constructor, and they do not
            //support inheritance.

            //Because structs are value types, when they are instantiated, we must
            //give them the appropriate values for their properties.
            //We can instantiate a struct in three ways.
            //The first way is to rely on the default values of the struct's properties.

            Console.WriteLine(coach.Name); //Null
            Console.WriteLine(coach.YearsCoaching); //0

            //The second way is to give each publicly-accessible property a value
            //using inline instantiation.

            //Microsoft recommends we create immutable structs, or structs that can
            //only have their property values set at instantiation.
            //We mark a struct as immutable using the keyword "readonly".
            //(See the Struct.cs file for ReadonlyPlayer struct).

            //See the Enums.cs file for more.

            //We don't want to do this:
            var color = 1; //What does 1 mean? We do not know.

            //Rather, we can impart a meaning on our variable by using an enumeration.
            var myColor = Color.Red;
            Console.WriteLine(myColor); //Red

            //We can also cast an enumeration both to and from its source type.

            //Bitwise flag enums can be combined using the logical OR operator (|)
